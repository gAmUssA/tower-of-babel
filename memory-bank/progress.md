- ‚úÖ Fixed service configuration issues
  - Corrected port configurations in all scripts
    - Inventory Service: port 9000 (was incorrectly checked as 8000)
    - Order Service: port 9080 (was incorrectly checked as 8080)
    - Analytics API: port 9300 (correct)
  - Fixed health check endpoints to use correct ports
  - Fixed schema subject names to use correct topic-value convention (orders-value)
  - Updated documentation and scripts for consistency
- ‚úÖ Fixed Python Inventory Service dependency issues
  - Created Python virtual environment
  - Installed required dependencies
  - Updated Makefile to use virtual environment
  - Fixed dotenv import in main.py
- ‚úÖ Fixed Analytics API dashboard issue
  - Updated package.json to copy public files during build
  - Added copy-public script to ensure dashboard.html is available
  - Verified dashboard is accessible at http://localhost:9300/analytics/dashboard
- ‚úÖ Tested Phase 3 failure scenarios
  - Successfully ran Java serialization failure demo
  - Successfully ran JSON field name mismatch demo
  - Successfully ran type inconsistency failure demo
  - All services are functioning correctly
- ‚úÖ Enhanced Makefile with improved clean and build tasks
  - Added service-specific cleaning steps for Java, Python, and Node.js services
  - Improved build process with better dependency management and virtual environments
- ‚úÖ Cleaned up Inventory Service codebase
  - Removed redundant src/ directory
  - Removed duplicate venv/ directory (keeping only .venv/)
  - Updated README.md with accurate project structure
  - Updated pyproject.toml to remove unused dependencies
  - Cleaned up Python cache files
- ‚úÖ Fixed Python compatibility issues

  - Created comprehensive automation scripts for demo state management
  - Enhanced Makefile with demo commands (demo-broken, demo-fixed, demo-evolution)
  - Created scripts for service lifecycle management (start/stop broken/avro services)
  - Implemented schema evolution demo with compatibility testing
  - Created comprehensive documentation for schema evolution scenarios
  - Achieved demo reset time of ~4.5 seconds (well under 30-second target)
  - Added schema registration automation with register-schemas.sh
  - Enhanced code generation automation with visual demonstrations
